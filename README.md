ok we are going to make a latching system with arduino to automate switshing on and off

1ST what we need to make the circut

Microcontroller or Development Board, for example: ESP32 Dev Board (read ESP32 boards review) ESP8266 NodeMCU (read ESP8266 boards review) Arduino UNO (read best Arduino Starter Kits) NDP6020P Transistor P-Channel MOSFET 2N3904 Transistor BJT NPN Resistors: 220K Ohm, 2x 100K Ohm, 10K Ohm, and 220 Ohm 2x Diodes (for example: 1N5819) Switch/Pushbutton 5V Power Supply
